For the bests results "Run as Administrator" through CMD and/or Powershell

Identify Suspicious Processes
-------------------------------

Command line
tasklist
tasklist /v
tasklist /m
tasklist /v /fi "pid eq 555"
tasklist /m /fi "pid eq 555"
Tasklist /v | findstr Teams.exe

Wmic is even more powerful than Tasklist.

wmic process list brief
wmic process list full
wmic process get Name,Commandline,Description,ProcessID,ParentProcessID
wmic process where Name=Teams.exe get ProcessID,ParentProcessID
wmic process where ProcessID=555

Watch out for:
1) Is this a new or unrecognized process? ( ideally you would want to cross reference your findings with a baseline image -if you have. It will make the whole task of identifying what stands out from "normal activity" easier)
2) Is the name of the Process random-looking ( e.g hJoIuG.exe or whatever)
3) Is it running from a non-standard path ( e.g C:\Temp , C:\Downloads , C:\Music etc)
4)  Is the parent suspicious ( child process might be legit but parent process not)
5) Is the Parent-Child relationship suspicious? ( e.g lsass.exe spawning a cmd.exe or IEX spawning a Powershell.exe etc)
6) Is the process tied to suspicious activity? ( e.g a process communicating with well known malicious IP/URL/host/domain etc)
7) Encoded in Base64 ?
8) A process can be used for benign and malicious purposes at the same time. ( e.g PSEXEC ) 
9) Suspicious does not necessarily mean Malicious.


Identifying Suspicious Network Activity
-----------------------------------------

netstat -abno ( this is pretty much all you need)
netstat -abno -n 5 = Automatically refresh the output every 5 seconds.
-n = 
-a = 
-b = shows the EXE using that port and the DLLs that it has loaded to interact with that port.
-o = shows the owner ProcessID associated with the port

Watch out for:
1) Network activity that is abnormal for the associated Process  (e.g Notepad outbound/inbound connections to a Public IP etc)
2) Network activity that is abnormal for your environment/Business Unit/Organization ( e.g lots of traffic during weekends, late hours, holidays etc, long running HTTP/HTTPS sessions etc) ( 2 ways to spot this kind of activity- either have a baseline image of Business as usual activity or know VERY WELL your environment/org/BU)
3) Network activity from/to well known Malicious IPs/Domains/URLs/Hosts  ( leverage Threat Intel & OSINT to identify those IOCs e.g alienvault , abuseipdb , virustotal, hybrid-analysis)


Identifying Suspicious Services
----------------------------------

services.msc = spawns the services control panel GUI . shows various services and their Description, Status, Startup Type, Log on as. shows ALL services (running/not running)
net start = shows a list of ONLY running services.
sc query | more = vast amount of information for each service . can be chaotic.  ONLY running services
tasklist /svc = shows which services are running out of each process on your system  along with their PIDs. maps running processes to services

Watch out for:
1) New services / Deleted services / Stopped Services (  ideally you would want to cross reference your findings with a baseline image -if you have. Otherwise talk with your Sys Admins. ) 
2) Path to Executable looks abnormal( run services.msc --> right click on a service --> Properties)


Identify Suspicious Registry ASEPs/Autostart Folders
------------------------------------------------------

Windows has numerous registry and file locations that can be used to start software without a user taking a specific action.These locations are called Autostart Extensibility Points (ASEPs)

The majority of malware manipulates the same registry keys.Those are: 


C:\> regedit = spawns the Registry Editor -GUI to manually browse through the registry hive/keys
C:\> reg query HKLM\Software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run = displays the settings for the specified registry key

These registry keys are responsible for executing programs when a system boots up or when a user logs on (Easiest way to establish persistence.Usually attackers map their backdoors there in order to survive reboot)

Autostart folders associated with users.These programs are automatically invoked each time the given user logs on to the system and are sometimes altered by malware

C:\> dir \s \b "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup = lists the contents of a user's autostart folder
C:\> start msconfig.exe = spawns a small GUI that displays Startup selection, Boot location/options , startup items
C:\> wmic startup list full = displays autostart programs
Right click on Tray bar --> Task Manager --> Startup = displays a GUI with autostart programs and info such as Name, Publisher, Status.


HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx


Watch out for:

1)
2)
3)
4)


Identify Suspicious Account Activity
--------------------------------------

c:\> lusrmgr.msc = spawns a GUI which can be used to check the users and groups defined on the machine
C:\> net user = displays a list of users
C:\>net localgroup administrators = shows who is in the group you specify ( in that case accounts in the administrators group)



Watch out for:

1)
2)
3)
4)


Identify Suspicious Scheduled Tasks
------------------------------------

C:\> schtasks = shows scheduled tasks and details about them such as Folder, Task Name, Next Run Time and Status (can be chaotic depending on your environment . you can export it to a .txt file for easier reading or use | findstr if you know what you are looking for )
Start-->Programs-->Acessories-->System Tools-->Scheduled Tasks = Task Scheduled GUI

Watch out for:

1)Unusual scheduled tasks ( especially those that run as SYSTEM, as a user in administrators group or have a blank username)
2)Scheduled Tasks




Identify Suspicious Log Entries
-------------------------------

Cl\>eventvwr.msc = spawns the GUI Event Viewer ( the most eye-friendly way lol)
C:\> wevtutil qe Security /f:text = inspect the Windows EveNt Logs category you specified(in this case Security) . can be chaotic, you can output the content by using > C:\xx\xx\something.txt if you want.
PS C:\> Get-EventLog -LogName Security | Format-List -Property * = the equivalent of the above command but in Powershell this time and with a cooler blue background ( lol)


Watch out for:

1) Any indication that event log service was stopped
2) Any indication that Windows File Integrity Checker ( Windows File Protection) was disabled
3) large number of failed logons about a specific account following a successful logon for that account
4) Large number of failed logons across many accounts ( Password Spray Attack)
5) Large number of failed logons for a specific account ( Brute Force Password Attack)





Regshot = snapshot tool for Windows.Allows you to record a snapshot of the registry and optionally file system at two points in time.
Provides a high level summary of the changes,showing registry keys that were added/deleted/modified as wel as any files that were added/deleted/modified
Super easy to run in 5 steps
1) Start Regshot and configure the options.By default Regshot is not going to record file system.You can specifiy that if you want by checking the Scan dir box and stating the directory you are interested in ( C:\ for example)
2) Once you are done with the configuration of the tool and you got everything ready take the first snapshot
3) Run the malware
4) Use Regshot to take a second snapshot
5) Once finished , click on Compare and Regshot will give you back the results after a few minutes


TaskManager
DeepBlueCLI
Procmon / Process Monitor = shows file system,registry,network and process activity in real-time.Ideal for detonating malicious files/scripts in a sandbox and see live the changes on your system
Procexplorer / Process Explorer = gives in depth information about running processes
Strings = extracts and displays bot ASCII and 16-bit little endian Unicode strings
C:\> strings malfile.exe
TCPView = maps listening TCP/UDP port back to owning processes
SRUMdump
FTK Imager /Volexity / Volatility (Remember . Most volatile FIRST = RAM . then everything else follows)


C:\> certutil -hashfile malfile.exe MD5 = Calculates the MD5 Hash of a file on Windows
